# What Can JavaScript Do For You?
## _An Exercise for Code Louisville_

### Get Started
1. Fork
    - "Forking" a repo will create a copy of it on your own GitHub profile.
    - There is a loose connection back to the home repo but we can cover that later.
    - To create a fork, __make sure you are signed in__ and click the "fork" button in the upper left.
      - ![Start creating the fork](./img/readme-imgs/create-fork.png "Create Fork")
    - Finalize the fork and click "Create fork".
      - ![Finalize the fork creation](./img/readme-imgs/finalize-fork.png "Finalize Fork")
2. Clone
    - Find an ideal folder on your machine and clone YOUR version of this repo that you just made under your Github.
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/{{YOUR_USERNAME}}/CodeLouJSPractice.git
        ```
3. Live Server
    - We highly recommend that you use Live Server to view the rendered project. Its a valuable VSCode extension!
    - [Download](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
4. Explore!
    - Look around the project! Tweak stuff, break stuff, view in the debugger, etc.
    - Please reach out to your mentors if you have any questions about what you see!

### Disclaimers
- This project deviates slightly from the folder/file layout we discussed in class. This project has a more "component" approach to keep it organized for demonstration purposes.
- Some of the element styling can be a little complex! Please ask your mentors if you have any questions.
  - Note: For simplicity, not everything has a great deal of styling put into it.
